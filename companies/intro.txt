Background

My name is Paolo and I'm currently a Software Development Engineer 
here at Amazon, and I am currently a part of the Amazon Freight team. 
This team is basically on the transporation side of the company where 
we essentially build applications and provide shipping services for 
customers such as large-scale freight companies, all the way down to 
small/medium businesses. So throughout my time here, I've been able 
to ship multiple projects with the team, working on both the backend 
and the frontend of our services. As for specific programming 
languages, I've primarily been working in Java here. Other notable 
experience I have is a couple of software engineering internships at 
Microsoft down in Redmond, Washington. There, I was on the Visual 
Studio team working on implementing features for the Visual Studio 
product. There, I primarily used C++. So I'd say my main programming 
languages I'm most familiar with are Java and C++. And yeah that's 
me, currently working full-time for Amazon, I have done multiple 
software engineering internships throughout my undergrad, and I 
graduated in Engineering from the University of Waterloo.

Interests

So for me, I'm primarily looking to try something new. Like I 
mentioned, until now I've been able to ship a few projects on my own, 
and I've learned a lot of valuable things and learned some useful 
skills. But now I'm really looking to pivot to something brand new 
and interesting. Then I came across {COMPANY_NAME} and thought it'd 
be cool to see what it's all about.
