- Early Career position
- Same for everybody
- July to August
- 5 rounds all in 1 day
- But can split to 2 days back to back, but default is only 1 day
- TN visa

- Positions I'm applying for at Google are SWE, L3
- All interviews are DS&A
- No interviews are scheduled are more than 4 weeks from today

- Will be getting email
- TODO: complete availability form
- Priority is important, esp. first 2
- 45 min interviews, 15 min breaks
- 1 week deadline for availability at the latest
- By April 22, should be done with the interviews

Technical Process
- 5 rounds
- 1 non-technical
- 45 mins
- all SWEs, no managers
- 15 min break between each interview
- 1 hour break after 2nd or 3rd interview (not needed if 2 days)

- 1-2 questions per round?
- What Platform?

4 Rounds Technical
- DS&A
- All LeetCode topics
- All randomized
- No system design questions
- Google's coding bar is high
- Each has a document link, except non-tech one
- Google Video Call
- Click into document 1 for first interview, for example
- Google Docs, no prediction but have syntax highlighting
- Find bugs manually
- No compiling
- Silent assess
- 3 things they grade on: coding ability, timing (optimal pref.), comms
- May be asked 2 questions: easy then medium/hard
- Most will have 2 questions actually
- Medium level questions 20-25 mins
- Need to explain thought-process
- If stuck, can ask for hint, ask questions
- Analytical/receptive I am if they chime in
- Love it when questions are asked, ask as many as I want
- If asked the same question, call it out

- Hiring Commitee: completely separate
- They look at everything from an unbiased standpoint
- So not just the interviewers, but also HC

- 45 mins each, few mins small talk
- Easy 10-15 mins
- Medium/hard 20-25 mins

- Platform: some internal tool
- No screensharing

1 Round Non-Technical
- 45 mins

- Leadership: any experience I have
- At least 1 example of any leadership I have
- Ex. Led a project, led Amazon project
- How I use:
    - Decision-making
    - Communication
- Talk about a leadership quality I possess
- Initiative, rally up a team, being resourceful
- Will be randomized, may not necessarily be the last

- Googleyness
1. How I work independently, prioritize tasks, ex. bare tasks, how do I prioritize?
    - Have an example
2. Team setting, ex. how help team member if no time?
    - Schedule something, willing to be helpful, schedule tmo
3. How do I navigate ambiguity?
    - Task with min. instruction, ask if need help, etc.
4. How do I push myself outside of comfort zone to grow?
    - Ex. manager gives bad project, do I reject or be open-minded?
5. How do I handle conflicts? How did I handle it? What was the outcome?
    - Say "I" instead of "we"
    - Give impact at the end
    - STAR method
    - Ideally, positive win-win example
    - Just choose a positive conflict

Tips:
- Have a handful of stories ready
- They ask 4 main questions
- If 5th question, have a 5th example ready
- So in total have 5 examples ready
- If asked something I've never experienced before, be real
- But say, if you were in that situation, this is what I would do
- Hypothetical

Misc. Tips:
- 45 mins is the ideal timeframe

- Confident no rescheduling

- Get as much practice in as possible
- Tech and non-tech
- Practice the coding portion!!!

- LeetCode
- Google's tech bar bare high
- 50 coding questions, if you pass 25 optimal within time, can pass the bar

- Timeline
- 4 to 7-8 weeks at the time of virtual onsite
- If positively trending, then go to HC
- If not positively trending, process stops
- If HC yes, then move onto team matching
- If HC no, rip
- Team matching, shared to all managers
- Typically only 3 manager calls
- Then, rank the teams
- Ideally, match with 2nd or 3rd choice
- If no match, rip
