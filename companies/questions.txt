1. I'm currently a Canadian citizen, so I know I won't require a 
   lottery-based visa like the H-1B, however, I will require supporting 
   documents by the company to obtain a TN visa at the border. Is this 
   something that can be provided?
2. What location is this position for?
3. Will this position be in office, WFH, or hybrid?
4. How would you describe the company's culture and the WLB? On call?
5. What are the next steps and timeline for this process?
