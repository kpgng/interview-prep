Why Bloomberg?

So personally for me, I have 3 main reasons why I'm interested in 
Bloomberg:

1. My desire to try something new coupled with an interest in 
financial technology. I've always wanted to get into the fintech
space but I've never really had the opportunity. Again I'm working
at Amazon, I've worked at Microsoft, and both are away and different
from the realm of financial technology. And now with Bloomberg this 
seems to be my potential opportunity to try this out.

2. I'm aware that Bloomberg is heavily involved with philanthropy
and giving to charities, and I absolutely love that. I love the 
idea of knowing my company contributes to good things and contributes
to things like the environment, public health, innovation, etc.
Just knowing that I could be working for a company like that is 
a huge positive for me.

3. I want to stay in the realm of working for a company that has 
a global impact, and clearly that's something Bloomberg has. I mean
the company develops so many things like the Bloomberg Terminal, 
News, Radio, etc. All these huge fintech products and mass media 
services. I want to continue to create real impact.
