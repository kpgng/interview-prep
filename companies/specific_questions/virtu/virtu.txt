A hash table (hash map) is a data structure 
that can map keys to values. A hash table uses 
a hash function to compute an index, also called 
a hash code, into an array of buckets, from 
which the desired value can be found. 

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key 
to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs 
emply an imperfect hash function, which might 
cause hash collisions where the hash function 
generates the same index for more than one key.

Example hash function: f(k) = H mod N
f = hash function
k = key
H = hash
N = size of hash table
hash = hashFunction(key)
index = hash % hashTableSize

Collision resolution: chaining

Building a linked list with key-value pair for 
each search array index. The collided items are 
chained together through a single linked list, 
which can be traversed to access the item with 
a unique search key.
