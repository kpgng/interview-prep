Hash Maps

A hash table (hash map) is a data structure 
that can map keys to values. A hash table uses 
a hash function to compute an index, also called 
a hash code, into an array of buckets, from 
which the desired value can be found. 

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key 
to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs 
emply an imperfect hash function, which might 
cause hash collisions where the hash function 
generates the same index for more than one key.

Example hash function: f(k) = H mod N
f = hash function
k = key
H = hash
N = size of hash table
hash = hashFunction(key)
index = hash % hashTableSize

Collision resolution: chaining

Building a linked list with key-value pair for 
each search array index. The collided items are 
chained together through a single linked list, 
which can be traversed to access the item with 
a unique search key.

C++ vs Java

Similarities
- Both OOP

Differences
- Compiler & Interpreter: compiled vs. compiled & interpreted
- Memory Management: manual (except smart ptrs) vs. garbage collection
- Overloading: supports overloading vs. doesn't support overloading 
- Language Support: system programming vs. application programming 
- Data & Functions: global scope/outside class vs. package/class scope
- Pointers: supports pointers vs. only limited support for pointers 
- Parameter Passing: call by value & reference vs. only call by value 

Project 1

- Inputs: Kp, Ti, Td
- Optimal fitness value updated whenever curr gen is better, additive 
- Outputs: ISE, tr, ts, Mp
- Improve fitness value over 150 generations, explore/exploit inputs 
- Crossover: +'ve & -'ve deltas for all params, mutation: for 1 param 

Project 2

- A* search implemented using min heap {F cost -> {x, y}}
- F cost = G cost (start to curr) + H cost (curr to end)
- BFS traversal with heuristic = A*, guarantees shortest paths
