Why Bloomberg?

So personally for me, I have 3 main reasons why I'm interested in 
Bloomberg:

1. My desire to try something new coupled with an interest in 
financial technology. I've always wanted to get into the fintech
space but I've never really had the opportunity. Again I'm working
at Amazon, I've worked at Microsoft, and both are away and different
from the realm of financial technology. And now with Bloomberg this 
seems to be my potential opportunity to try this out.

2. I'm aware that Bloomberg is heavily involved with philanthropy
and giving to charities, and I absolutely love that. I love the 
idea of knowing my company contributes to good things and contributes
to things like the environment, public health, innovation, etc.
Just knowing that I could be working for a company like that is 
a huge positive for me.

3. I want to stay in the realm of working for a company that has 
a global impact, and clearly that's something Bloomberg has. I mean
the company develops so many things like the Bloomberg Terminal, 
News, Radio, etc. All these huge fintech products and mass media 
services. I want to continue to create real impact.

Why Integration Gateway?

1. Always had an interest in the financial technology space, this
looked like a good opportunity to achieve that.

2. Particularly for Integration Gateway, what caught my eye was the
GNET and the GNET engine, where you build things that provide
customers with a visual programming language and be able to integrate
that between Bloomberg and 3rd party systems. Sounds very interesting.

3. Listed projects also sounded interesting: next-gen code-gen,
compilation, and execution framework for example.

4. Interest in the technology stack: Java/C# for the backend,
building desktop UI and WPF applications, React for the frontend.

Question:

Primarily what is this system an integration between? Between
like Bloomberg's trading solutions/order management systems and
external clients?
