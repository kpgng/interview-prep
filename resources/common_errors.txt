Debugging

1. Possible Bugs:

- Count Occurrences
Missing i++ at the end of while loop

- Print Pattern
Missing { } to wrap up the two lines of code in a for loop,
causing the second line to be excluded from the for loop

- Insert Sort Descending Order
Change ‘>’ (greater than) to ‘<‘ (less than)

- Select Sort
Change arr[min] > arr[x] to arr[min] > arr[y]

- Reverse Array
Change arr[len-1] to arr[len-i-1] and
remove len += 1 at the end of the loop

- Manchester Array
Change result = (a[i] == a[i-1]) to result = (a[i] != a[i-1])
and same for ret[0]

- Check Grades
Change both of || to &&

- Replace Even/Odd Values
Change i <= len and j <= len to < 6

Tips:

- Sorting Functions
Most likely given in the wrong order
Fix: Find if statement and reverse the condition for comparison

- TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)
Dead while loop
Fix: Check for i++ at the end

- For Loop
Missing { }
Fix: Check whether { } is there for the for loops

2. Errors in C/C++:

- Syntax Errors
Missing parenthesis, using variable without/before declaring,
and missing semicolon

- Runtime Errors
Division by zero

- Linker Errors
Function prototype, incorrect headers, Main() instead of main()

- Logical Errors
Semicolon after loop, ignoring what should be looped

- Semantic Errors
a + b = c instead of c = a + b

3. Common Syntax and Semanic Errors:

- Syntax Errors
Missing semicolon (int a instead of int a;)
Lowercase/uppercase (int mynum; instead of int myNum;)
Missing namespace (using namespace std and cout)
Unmatched parentheses (val = (low + high / 2;)
Unterminated strings (str = "hello;)
L-value errors (a + b = c instead of c = a + b)
Non void function with no return statement
Data type of argument and parameter don't match

- Syntax Warnings
Using "=" when "==" is intended (if (num = 100))
Loop has no body (semicolon at end of loop) 
Uninitialized variable, then used

- Semantic Errors
Infinite loop (using || instead of &&)
Operator precedence (val = (low + high) / 2)
Dangling else (missing brackets with if's)
Off-by-one (loop start at 0 instead of 1, < instead of <=)
Array index bounds (accessing past the end)

4. Syntactical Errors:

Using incorrect capitalization
Missing parentheses
Forgetting to import a library
Missing curly braces
Omitting break from switch statements
Omitting return statement
